== Changelog ==
= 2.10 =
* New: Retrieving Access Tokens and connecting multiple Instagram accounts is now easier using our improved interface for managing account information. While on the Configure tab, click on the big blue button to connect an account, or use the "Manually Connect an Account" option to connect one using an existing Access Token. Once an account is connected, you can use the associated buttons to either add it to your primary User feed or to a different feed on your site using the `user` shortcode option, eg: `user=smashballoon`.
* Tweak: Disabled auto load in the database for backup caches and white lists
* Fix: Fixed a issue where comments could display potentially harmful HTML - Thanks Jonas Carlsson from Sweden!
* Fix: Removed code and support for using user names in user ID settings. Will now default to the user ID attached to the Access Token.

* Fix: Comments not being retrieved with the correct Access Token
* Fix: Automatic loading of more posts on scroll disabled for carousel feeds

= 2.9.7 =

= 2.9.5 =
* Important: Due to [recent changes](https://smashballoon.com/instagram-api-changes-april-4-2018/) in the Instagram API it is no longer possible to display photos from other Instagram accounts which are not your own. You can only display the user feed of the account which is associated with your Access Token.
* New: Added an Access Token shortcode option and support for multiple Access Tokens. If you own multiple Instagram accounts then you can now use multiple Access Tokens in order to display user feeds from each account, either in separate feeds, or in the same feed. Just use the `accesstoken` shortcode option. See [this FAQ](https://smashballoon.com/display-multiple-instagram-feeds/#multiple-user-feeds) for more information on displaying multiple User feeds.

* Tweak: Changed how the caching errors caused by page caching plugins are handled
* Tweak: If you're using an Ajax theme and calling the plugin's `sbi_init()` function when the page content loads then we advise updating this to add a caching parameter.

* New: Comments for individual posts are now available to be displayed in the lightbox. Enable this on the "Customize" tab or by adding this to your shortcode: `[instagram-feed lightboxcomments="true"]`. The number of comments shown can be changed as well: `[instagram-feed numcomments="10"]`.
* New: Create a "Shoppable" feed using links in the captions of your Instagram posts. Check the box next to this setting on the "Customize" tab or add this to the shortcode: `[instagram-feed captionlinks="true"]`. This requires an extra step when you post to Instagram.

* Fix: Instagram's new "Slideshow" post feature isn't supported yet by their API and so this was causing an error in feeds that included them. This error has been fixed but as Instagram hasn't yet added support in their API for slideshow posts then the plugin isn't able to display them. Once they add support then it will be added into the plugin.

= 2.3 =
* New: Added the ability to display a feed of specific posts. You can do this by using the `single` shortcode setting. First set the feed type to be "single", then paste the ID of the post(s) into the single shortcode setting, like so: `[instagram-feed type="single" single="sbi_1349591022052854916_10145706"]`.
